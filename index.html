      "When we first started talking, I never could have imagined that we would connect so deeply.<br>
      From the moment I met you, I knew there was something special about you - something that drew me in and made my heart skip a beat.<br>
       You are more than amazing, you are the embodiment of everything I've ever wanted in a partner: funny, kind, and simply spectacular.<br> These past few months with you have been nothing short of magical, and I still can't believe how lucky I am to have you in my life. <br>
       Every moment with you feels like a dream come true, and I can't wait to see what our future holds together.<br>
       This is to the point it feels like we have been together for years and I love that for us. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My love, with the month of love here, my heart overflows with thoughts of you.<br> I truly believe you are my soulmate, and I am constantly building towards a life with you.<br> 
      I am grateful for your presence in my life and promise to cherish you always.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all that being said, I have to ask you, if you will do me the honour of being my Valentine?❤️❤️ 
    </p>
